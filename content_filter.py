Content Filtering Module
This module contains functionalities for filtering objectionable content from videos using AI-based models,
speech recognition, and NLP-based text classification, without modifying or downloading content.
Instead, the AI seamlessly processes videos in real-time by fast-forwarding, muting, or skipping sections.
